Abilities are all the possible actions a character can do in a turn, active or passive, besides [[Movement]] or contextual actions (such as talking or interacting with an object). All abilities have an [[AP]] cost, a description, a [[Cooldown]], a character they are tied to, and unlock conditions that are tied to narrative and combat events.

Abilities function as a script that executes a short series of commands, such as healing, throwing, or attacking an area. Every ability starts as "Ready" until executed, in which it then starts counting down from its Cooldown maximum to is Cooldown minimum each [[Round]]. When it reaches the minimum, it resets its current Cooldown to the maximum, and sets its status to "Ready" to be used again.
