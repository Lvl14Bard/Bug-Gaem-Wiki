# Notes

Paramantis' 3rd unlockable ability. Draws all enemies 2 tiles towards self, or right next to self if that's within 2 tiles. This is the only move to manipulate enemies' position on the map without attacking them, but since it affects every single foe on the map, this can be lead to unexpected consequences...
