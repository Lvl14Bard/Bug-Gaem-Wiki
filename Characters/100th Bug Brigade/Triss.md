## Lore
A bastard child of [[Bee]] and [[Yellow Jacket]] nobility. Known for her wicked sting on the battlefield, Trice rose up the ranks in the only way she could, military service. Hated by her family on both sides for her blood, her [[Queen Bee]] mother pushes her one daughter to cut throat greatness, at any cost. Trice will not be forgotten as a mistake, and will rise above the [[100th Bug Brigade]] and become the next Queen. She will pull herself up from the muck of those lower than her, and punish those who have cast her out when she reaches the top.
