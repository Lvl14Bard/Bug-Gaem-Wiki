Idle Animation: Triss is full of energy. Her wings flutter rapidly.  Every now and then, she looks around with a tough expression. She's uncertain of what surrounds her, but determined to beat whatever it is up.
## Lore
A bastard child of [[Bee]] and [[Yellow Jacket]] nobility. Known for her wicked sting on the battlefield, Trice rose up the ranks in the only way she could, military service. An embarrassment to her family on both sides for her blood, her [[Queen Bee]] mother pushes her one daughter to cut throat greatness, at any cost. Triss will not be forgotten as a mistake, and will rise above the [[100th Bug Brigade]] and become the next Queen. She will pull herself up from the muck of those lower than her, and punish those who have cast her out when she reaches the top.
