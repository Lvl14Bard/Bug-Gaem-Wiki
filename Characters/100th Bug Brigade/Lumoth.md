## Backstory
A lowly priestess of [[Lunalesca]], the Moth goddess of the Moon. The [[Cult of Lunalesca]] always teaches her followers to be impartial, patient, and removed, and she has always followed her teachings. But on the night of the [[Robug]] invasion of the [[Great Tree]], Lumoth, deep in prayer, heard a call from Lunalesca herself: "They will come for the Garden of Lights. You must fight to protect it." She knew that if this were true, she would be going against the cult and its teachings, and challenging the very foundations of the cult. Lunalesca only speaks to the mute Luna Moth ([[Serenity]]) born once every 100 years. But in this time of crisis, did Lunalesca find a new voice?
