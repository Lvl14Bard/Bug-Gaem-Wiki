## Backstory
The mighty veteran Beetle, and friend of Zephyr. Atlas was a war hero in her prime, but she didn't fight for glory. She fights so that her friends and family will know peace, and will never need to put themselves on the line as she has. Her mighty [[chitin]] shell began to crack on the battlefield, but she stayed to win the war. She lived a peaceful life as a [[smithy]], working with chitin, stone, and steel with her wife who peacefully passed. But when the [[Robugs]] came to the [[Great Tree]], Atlas could no longer sit on the sidelines. She joined the military in the only posting that would take her, the [[100th Bug Brigade]], and now helps guide Zephyr through the trials of war.
