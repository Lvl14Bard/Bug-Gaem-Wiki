Idle Animation: Atlas breathes heavily, showing that she is easily tired in her old age, but is pressing on anyway, determined to be of worth.

## Lore
The mighty veteran Beetle, and friend of Zephyr. Atlas was a war hero in her prime, but she didn't fight for glory. She fights so that her friends and family will know peace, and will never need to put themselves on the line as she has. Her mighty [[Chitin]] shell began to crack on the battlefield, but she stayed to win the war. She lived a peaceful life as a [[smithy]], working with chitin, stone, and steel with her wife who peacefully passed. But when the [[Robugs]] came to the [[Great Tree]], Atlas could no longer sit on the sidelines. She joined the military in the only posting that would take her, the [[100th Bug Brigade]], and now helps guide Zephyr through the trials of war.

## Abilities
- [[Knockback]]
- [[Horn Toss]]
- [[Empower]]

## Events

In the Garden of Lights, Atlas has a passive active that increases her HP, AP and Attack Power (of Knockback) +2.

Atlas is a boss fight in the second Cathedral of Moths stage. This is technically a separate unit. Here, her only move is Knockback, but it's much stronger in this form, as detailed on that page.
