## Lore
The [[Dragonfly]] squad lead. Born with a birth defect that prevents them from hunting alongside their proud warrior family ([[Zephyr's Parent]]). Zephyr has been given command as the only military service they can, simply to avoid family shame. Never giving up on themselves, despite their family, Zephyr uses their acute vision and incredible speed to map out the battlefield and issue accurate and rapid commands.
