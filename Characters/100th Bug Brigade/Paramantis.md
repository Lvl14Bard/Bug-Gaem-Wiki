Idle Animation: The fungus goop on Paramantis slides up and down his head as the mantis breathes in and out.
## Lore
A hideous outcast, two rivaling minds in one body, a [[Praying Mantis]] and a sentient fungal [[Parasite]]. The Praying Mantis are a proud warrior people (think Githyanki) who celebrate their isolation and bloodlust, and Mantis enjoyed every moment of his warrior life. But his life changed when, in the bloodlust of eating a raw kill, his mind was infected with a fungal rot that grew into a sentient parasite covering his body and eventually, partially controlling it. The parasite, in contrast, is a passive tree-hugger, who shamanistically observes and celebrates the cycles of life, death, decay, and rebirth alongside his spore-children. They do not get along, but are trying to live long enough to get rid of the other.

This has been retooled a bit so when we meet Paramantis, they have already completed this conflict and reached a peaceful symbiosis. Paramantis now sees beyond the bugs' warrior culture and into the greater cycle of life.
