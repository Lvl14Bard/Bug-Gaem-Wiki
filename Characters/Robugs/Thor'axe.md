Idle Animation:
	(Phase 1) Shining energy from the well flows through him, illuminating his body and moving through it. It's a powerful feeling, but remaining in place is a struggle.
	(Phase 2) Battered, he seethes with anger.
## Backstory

Triss' father. I remember reading he was the Yellowjacket leader / king, so I guess Triss was conceived as a royal bastard child between rival races.  Triss' father doesn't get along with Triss, or vice versa, but he doesn't want to kill her either. He warns her to stay away, but he *will* put her down if she interferes with his plans.
