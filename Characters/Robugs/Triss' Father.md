## Backstory

Triss' father. I remember reading he was the Yellowjacket leader / king, so I guess Triss was conceived as a royal bastard child between rival races.  Triss' father doesn't get along with Triss, or vice versa, but he doesn't want to kill her either. He warns her to stay away, but he *will* put her down if she interferes with his plans.

He is so fearsome that no one knows his real name or some stupid excuse like that for why we took so long to name him, oh no, no, no, I hope that doesn't end up in the real game oh no what have I done that's too appealing to lazy college students like us oh no oh no oh no oh no
