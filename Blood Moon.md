# Notes

This is Lumoth's 3rd ability, unlocked after the Cathedral of Moths. She can attack enemies and the damage she does is added to hear next Heal.

This stacks up to 8HP reserved, since the most any ally can be healed is from 1 HP to 12 HP, and Heal already heals 3 HP. There is no difference between a Heal+8HP from Blood Moon and any higher amount. (The UI won't show the max of 8, though, only the current amount. Players shouldn't be encouraged to max out HP per Heal, because that would be tedious.)
