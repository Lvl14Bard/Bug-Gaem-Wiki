The queen of the bugs in the tree, leader of bug society. The bug brigades live, fight, die, and live again, all in service of the Lady Bug, their queen.

[[Zephyr's Parent]] is the leader of the 1st Bug Brigade and guards the queen directly.

We might have the queen get roboticized and be the final boss ... this was the plan at one point, maybe the [[Robugs]] had a sleeper agent in the 1st Brigade, and they invaded at the exact moment the sleeper took the 1st Brigade out and the queen was roboticized ... now the 100th Bug Brigade, who avoided this chaos by being outside of the tree on their mission, have to find a way to return the Lady Bug to normal!

Or we'll do something else and Lady Bug is just background lore. We'll see!
