# Notes

Lumoth's secondary ability. Creates a shield around another unit which will completely negate 1 attack on them and disappear after 1 use. It also baton passes to the target.

**Animation**: Lumoth moves her arms in a semi-circular motion and a translucent white energy shield forms around the target to match the movement of her arms. (It will remain there until the target is hit.)
