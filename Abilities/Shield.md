# Notes

Lumoth's secondary ability. Creates a shield around another unit which will block 1 damage and disappear after 1 use. As a secondary ability, it also baton passes to the target. This may be changed to blocking 1 attack instead of 1 damage, just to make it more useful. Otherwise it's just a cheaper, worse [[Heal]].

**Animation**: Lumoth moves her arms in a semi-circular motion and a translucent white energy shield forms around the target to match the movement of her arms. (It will remain there until the target is hit.)
