# Notes
This is used by [[Thor'axe]] in his Garden of Lights second phase when he darts around the arena. It's a wide area and the main challenge is getting units out of the way in time. He uses it again in phase 1 of the Breach, which is tougher since it's a smaller arena. After starting his skewer, Thor'axe damages anything in his way, and continues forward even after hitting another unit. He continues until he hits a wall, the side of the arena, or goes a full nine spaces.

**Animation**: Thor'axe holds a pose like he's about to start running, then dashes forward with his stinger scraping across the ground. He holds his axe out, one arm stretched far in front of him, and swings his hand around wildly to swing the axe while keeping his arm straight and stretched in front of him.

Note: This move has been through a few iterations and may be changed again to be a big sweeping move where Thor'axe swings his axe in a semi-circle in front of him. Or maybe that'll be a separate move. Not 100% sure yet.
