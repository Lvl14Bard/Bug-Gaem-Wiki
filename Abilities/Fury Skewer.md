# Notes
This is used by [[Thor'axe]] in his second phase when he darts around the arena. It's a wide area and the main challenge is getting units out of the way in time. Since we've removed the honeycombs from the game plan, it will be a bit harder to make this a challenge ... so this attack may be buffed a LOT in testing.

**Animation**: In the setup, Thor'axe brings his body together as though charging up energy. In the payoff, he thrusts his thorax/stinger out and blasts the energy out from it, shaking a bit from recoil.
