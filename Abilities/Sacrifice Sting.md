# Notes

Triss' 3rd move, unlocked after Beehive Branch. When she uses it, she loses all of her HP and faints.

**Animation**: Triss twists her body a bit, revving up, then does a 360 degree spin in the opposite direction with her behind/stinger pointed out. The enemies around her are all hit by a smack effect. Or maybe there's a MASSIVE REALISTIC EXPLOSION overlaid onto the whole thing. ...OK, maybe not, but that would be funny. Triss faints afterwards.
