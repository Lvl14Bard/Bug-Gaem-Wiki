# Notes
Think of this as a weaker version of "Throw" that also does a tiny bit of damage. This is to give Atlas' weak attack some utility beyond the narrative idea that Atlas is old and weak.

**Animation**: Atlas shunts the enemy with a shoulder bash, which has enough force to push the foe back a tile.
