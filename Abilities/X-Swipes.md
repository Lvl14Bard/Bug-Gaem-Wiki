# Notes

Paramantis' secondary ability. Very powerful (with a possibility of dealing 6 DMG total) but baton passes to enemies, so cautious players will want to save it for finishing enemies off. For savvy players, this can be used strategically, to force enemies to spend their turns early. (If that is too OP, enemies will be made faster so there is more of a risk that baton pass grants them a 2nd turn.) Since Paramantis has very little AP, careful positioning is key to using this effectively.

**Animation**: Paramantis swipes at the enemy with each hand, one after the other.
