# Notes

Triss' secondary move. Use it once to grab another unit. Use it again to put them down. (If all AP is used, the carried unit will automatically fall out at the end of Triss' turn.)

**Animation**: Triss sheathes her weapon and grabs the target with both hands. (The sprites don't have to actually interact, but it should be clear to the player that this is what's happening.)
