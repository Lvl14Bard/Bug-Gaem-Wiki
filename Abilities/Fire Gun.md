# Notes

Termitator revs up and shoots a fireball projectile in all directions. It does 2 damage to any units it hits.

**Animation**: The Termitator throws a spinning chainsaw forward. It leans forward to throw it and returns to normal when it catches it. The chainsaw moves quickly near The Termitator and moves slower while it is near its target of 4 spaces away, even remaining still over that target space for a moment. The chainsaw spins as it moves throughout all of this.
