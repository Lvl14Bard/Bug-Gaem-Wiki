# Notes

The most powerful enemy melee attack, it's like [[Purebred Sting]] but over a longer range. But the Millibyte can move 1 space before using it, so as long as the player stays 3 spaces away from them, they'll be okay.

**Animation**: The Millibyte stretches the front part of its body forward so that it extends over multiple tiles, while the back part remains idle. It will stretch over its tile and 2 tiles in front/back/to the side of that. It whips the front of its body forward quickly and immediately whips it back, not lingering.
