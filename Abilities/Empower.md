# Notes

Atlas's 3rd ability, unlocked after the backtracking chase with the robot spider. Doubles the attack power of the target.

**Animation**: Green lines of energy move up from the bottom of the target to the top, with a green arrow appearing above the target's head. Atlas faces the target and raises her arms up while this happens.
