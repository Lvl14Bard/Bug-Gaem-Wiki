Abilities are all the possible actions a character can do in a turn, active or passive, besides [[Movement]] or contextual actions (such as talking or interacting with an object). All abilities have an [[AP]] cost, a description, a [[Cooldown]], a character they are tied to, and unlock conditions that are tied to narrative and combat events.
