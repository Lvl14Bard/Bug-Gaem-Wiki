HP stands for Health Points, and represents the character's life force. If a character's HP drops to zero, they are killed (see [[Death]]). HP has a maximum, a current, and minimum. HP maximum can never be below 1, current can never be above maximum or below minimum, and minimum is always 0. When a character is resurrected ([[Resurrection]]) by the [[Great Tree]], they have their maximum HP.
