HP stands for Health Points, and represents the character's life force. If a character's HP drops to zero, they are killed ([[Death]]). HP has a maximum, a current, and minimum. HP maximum can never be below 1, current can never be above maximum or below minimum, and minimum is always 0. 

[[Shield HP]] are a separate pool of points that can go above the maximum and are used before the current HP pool.
