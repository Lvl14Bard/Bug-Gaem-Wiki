# Notes

This move deals 2 damage, but in the form of doing 1 damage twice. The Termitator throws the chainsaw boomerang 4 spaces ahead, and it deals 1 damage to everything in its way, then it returns to the Termitator who threw it, dealing 1 damage to everything in its way again.

I think this is only an aesthetic difference for now. However, if we add any reactive gambits that react to being hit, those will trigger twice, once for each hit of the chainsaw boomerang.

This move uses all of the Termitator's AP, so it cannot move and attack in the same turn. This is there to counteract the range of this move. If you get hit by it, it's your own fault for getting within range of the Termitator and not managing to kill it before it attacks.
