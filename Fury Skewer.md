# Notes
This is used by [[Triss' Father]] in his second phase when he darts around the arena. It's a wide area and the main challenge is getting units out of the way in time. Since we've removed the honeycombs from the game plan, it will be a bit harder to make this a challenge ... so this attack may be buffed a LOT in testing.
